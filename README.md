vodk.rs
=======

This repository contains various things I am toying with including:

- sid_vec: Tiny library providing id types and an id-based vector.
- vodk_math: A strongly typed vector/matrix library, If you are thinking of using this, you should use the euclid crate instead.
- vodk_gpu: my old opengl wrapper that you shouldn't use because glium and gfx-rs are better.
- ...other junk not worth looking at.
