vodk.rs
=======

Rust experiments, mostly around game programming related stuff.

Mostly compatible with rust:
    rustc 0.13.0-nightly (0669a432a 2014-12-15 22:11:44 +0000)


Building
========

Note: Actually in order to build you have to invok `cargo build` in each sub-crate.
This will redownload and compile each dependancies.

It's quite hacky. This will be fixed in the future.
